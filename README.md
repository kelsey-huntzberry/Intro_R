# Introduction to R Programming Class

Welcome to Introduction to R Programming! We will be using Github in order to share both code and PowerPoint. I will add the materials by 9 AM the morning of class and earlier if possible!

I created a Slack channel for you all to collaborate and ask questions. The Slack channel is called r-programming-class and the link is: https://join.slack.com/t/learningrinaustin/shared_invite/enQtNjQ3MTcxMTczOTQyLTU4NWU2OGU5ZWQ5YzIwMTRhYjRiZTI3ODM1Yjc3ZTcwY2VjOGZkNjg2MzE1ODA1ZDA0YTRjMzNjYmIxOWQ1YmM

I will send the links for our meetings the day prior to class through Meetup or Eventbrite depending on how you signed up to attend, in person or remotely.

Welcome to class! I'm looking forward to meeting you all!
